#Style Tweaks Needed

When the element is focused we add a `.focus` class to the wrapping `.form-control` element. For proper bootstrap styling you have to extend the following classes to also include `.form-control.focus` class.

 - `.form-control:focus`
 - `.has-success .form-control:focus`
 - `.has-warning .form-control:focus` 
 - `.has-error .form-control:focus`

You can do this using your favorite pre-process and extending the class (recommended), or editing the actual bootstrap files
